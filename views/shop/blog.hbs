						<p class="stext-113 cl6 p-b-26">
                            Once upon a time, in a world where fashion trends were dictated by a select few, there was a little company called Trendly. Trendly was started by a group of passionate fashion enthusiasts who believed that everyone had the right to express themselves through their clothing and accessories. They wanted to challenge the status quo and create a space where people could explore their personal style without judgment.
                            With their motto, "time to change," the Trendly team set out to revolutionize the fashion industry. They traveled the world, sourcing unique pieces from up-and-coming designers and established fashion houses alike. They handpicked items that were not only stylish but also sustainable, ensuring that they were doing their part for the planet.

                            As word of their unique collection spread, Trendly began to grow rapidly. But they never lost sight of their core mission. They continued to inspire people to embrace their individuality and break free from the constraints of mainstream fashion. They created a community of like-minded individuals who celebrated diversity and encouraged one another to be their authentic selves.
                            Today, Trendly is a global fashion destination, loved by fashionistas and trendsetters around the world. But their dedication to their customers and the planet has never wavered. They continue to curate a collection that is both stylish and sustainable, and they remain committed to their mission of empowering people to express themselves through fashion.
                            So if you're looking for a shopping experience that's more than just buying clothes, look no further than Trendly. Join the movement, and let's change the world, one outfit at a time.

								Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.
